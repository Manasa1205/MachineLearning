Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training and evaluation.
Model Training: Implementation of KNN with different values of k.
Model Evaluation: Assessment using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Usage: Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially to explore data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

# LeNet-5 Architecture Implementation:
This notebook implements the LeNet-5 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), one of the earliest and most well-known architectures for image recognition tasks.

Features
Architecture Overview: Explanation of LeNet-5 layers and structure.
Model Building: Implementation using TensorFlow/Keras.
Model Training: Training on a sample dataset (e.g., MNIST).
Evaluation: Testing the model and visualizing results.
Usage: Open the notebook and execute each cell to walk through the architecture, training process, and results evaluation.

# NLP Sentimental Analysis of Large Movie Review Dataset:
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiment in a large movie review dataset. The dataset contains positive and negative reviews, and the goal is to classify sentiment using machine learning models.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and text vectorization using TF-IDF.
Model Training: Implementation of machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and LSTMs for sentiment classification.
Model Evaluation: Performance assessment using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Graphical representation of word distributions and model performance metrics.
Usage: Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially to explore text preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
