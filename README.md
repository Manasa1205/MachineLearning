This repository contains two implementations for different machine learning algorithms. The first is an application of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, 
and the second is an implementation of the LeNet-5 convolutional neural network architecture. Each notebook includes step-by-step instructions, explanations, and
code to demonstrate the working principles of these methods.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow, keras


##1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Application
Notebook: ML_Assignment_1_final.ipynb

This notebook demonstrates an application of the KNN algorithm on a dataset. The KNN algorithm is a non-parametric, instance-based learning method often used for classification tasks. In this notebook, you will find:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training and evaluation.
Model Training: Implementation of KNN with different values of k.
Model Evaluation: Assessment of the model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Usage: Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially to understand the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation process.

##2. LeNet-5 Architecture Implementation
Notebook: Implementation_of_LeNet-5_Architecture.ipynb

This notebook implements the LeNet-5 architecture, one of the earliest and most well-known convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed for image recognition tasks. The notebook covers:

Architecture Overview: Explanation of the LeNet-5 layers and structure.
Model Building: Implementation of the LeNet-5 architecture using TensorFlow/Keras.
Model Training: Training the model on a sample dataset (such as MNIST).
Evaluation: Testing the model and visualizing the results.
Usage: Open the notebook and execute each cell to walk through the architecture, training process, and results evaluation.
